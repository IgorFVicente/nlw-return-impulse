## NLW RETURN FEEDGET PROJECT

This is the web repository of a [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) basic project intended for learning useful tools used in modern web development.

The full project stack includes Typescript, Node, React, Tailwind, Jest and React Native with some concepts of SOLID to improve code quality.

It was a fun project to code along, with lots of new concepts to learn and a nice final result :)
